    "\n",
    "  *   S - Initial (start) position. There's only one initial state on the map and its always on the upper-left corner of the grid.\n",
    "  *   G - Final state. As learned in class there may be multiple goal states.\n",
    "  *   H - Hole. When your agent reaches a hole, it falls into the water and cannot continue walking.\n",
    "  *   D - Dragon Ball. There are either two on the map. When the agent reaches a Dragon Ball, it is immediately collected. You can assume that they will not appear in a final or initial state.\n",
    "  *   F - This is the most common square on the map. The agent can walk on it safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Your agent can move faster by collecting 3 special objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *   T - [Talaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talaria). A pair of Winged Sandals that help you fly to the square.\n",
    "  *   A - Air jorden. Jumping shoes that help you jump to the square.\n",
    "  *   L - Lightning. Makes you run faster to the square.\n",
    "\n",
    "  When the agent performs transition (s,a,s') and collects one of the objects (T,A,L) at state s', the collected object changes the cost of the transition (as detailed below). \n",

    "3. The cost of each transition (s,a,s') is based on the mark if the square s' you pass to:\n",
    "  * S - 1\n",

    "  * H - ֿ$\\infty$\n",
